                  "Marc": "The Divine Comedy is so divine (I pass the redundancy) that we can bring some of Dante's narration to our day. Without necessarily dividing our moments into stages, we do not have to die to see the scenes we have passed. Nowadays, humanity, so sordid and unmasked, acts, treating one another personally, as if it had a particular Heaven of false power, knowing it lives in a real Hell. Worse still is not to reach out to the next, pushing them to innumerable Purgatory at once, offering no other choice. The owners of a power gaining millions and millions pretend to have mercy on suffering humanity. They continue with their shenanigans and lies, wanting the humiliated citizen to believe he is in Heaven because they are still alive. These greedy people, whom we know very well, live in an actual and particular Hell in the dispute of who can do more. People with low incomes and suffering workers are already in Purgatory. Until, occasionally, they feed a false hope that one day they will live in the Heaven of the mighty, causing paraphernalia among the many greedy miserable ones who are taking life. Pushing and trampling those who try to pass before them because many are in a hurry and believe they can get out of Purgatory and reach the Infernal Heaven of illusion and social inequality."
